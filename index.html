    <p>To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard or swipe left, right, up, or down on your touchscreen device to move the tiles in the corresponding direction. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide, doubling their value. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048. Keep combining tiles strategically to prevent the grid from filling up, as the game ends when there are no more valid moves. Good luck!</p>
